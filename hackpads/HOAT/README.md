## Inspiration
I made this based on the default hackpad, except now it has a encoder wheel, which is amazing for brightness control and volume control. [@booboojp](https://github.com/booboojp) is my extremely handsome friend who was a calming prescense the entire time.

## Challenges
This was my first time doing any hardware lab, let alone using KiCAD. Overall, it was a refreshing start and I will definitely be doing more hardware YSWS's such as the big hackpad and infill.
